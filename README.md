One of the most common errors that appear in inventory systems is the information loaded from the marketplace that was written by clients themselves. 
Their addresses, names, etc. I personally prefer to keep order in invoice documents, so I have implemented a simple script that takes all orders from a selected folder and alters information to be written correctly.

The script makes use of an API shared by the inventory platform Baselinker. 
More information about API and methods needed for Baselinked data retrival: https://api.baselinker.com/index.php

The information on the screen shots is a dummy example not REAL PERSONAL DATA!
